# Vite-React App

This is a starter template for a Vite-React app. It provides a basic setup for building React applications using Vite, a fast and lightweight development server.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies by running the following command:
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```shell
   yarn
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```
   or
   ```shell
   yarn dev
   ```
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173` to see the running app.

## Folder Structure

The project structure is set up as follows:

```
.
├── public
│   └── favicon.ico
├── src
│   ├── components
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── data
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── images
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── pages
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── utils
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── index.js
│   └── main.css
├── .eslintrc.cjs
|── .gitignore
|── index.html
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── README.md
└── vite.config.js
```

- `public`: This directory contains the static files for your application, such as the `favicon.ico` file.
- `src`: This directory contains the source code for your application.
  - `components`: This directory is used to store reusable React components.
  - `data`: This directory can be used to store static data files, such as JSON files or configuration files.
  - `images`: This directory is used to store images and other media files used in the application.
  - `pages`: This directory contains individual page components for your application.
  - `utils`: This directory can be used to store utility functions or helper modules.
  - `index.css`: Global CSS styles
  - `main.js`: The entry point of the application.
- `package-lock.json`: This file is automatically generated by npm to lock down the specific versions of the installed packages.
- `package.json`: Contains the project's dependencies and scripts.
- `README.md`: This file, providing information about the project.
- `vite.config.js`: Configuration file for Vite.

Please note that the `index.html` file is located in the root directory of your project, alongside other files like `package.json` and `README.md`.

Feel free to modify the folder structure and files to suit your needs.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build` or `yarn build`: Builds the application for production.
- `npm run serve` or `yarn serve`: Serves the production build locally.
- `npm run lint` or `yarn lint`: Runs ESLint to check for linting errors.
- `npm run deploy` or `yarn deploy`: Deploys the application to Firebase Hosting.

Make sure to refer to the Vite documentation for more information on the available configuration options and additional scripts.

## Accessing Mobile Development Mode

To view your Vite-React app in mobile mode during development, you can use the built-in browser tools or device emulators available in most modern browsers. Here's how you can achieve this:

Open your Vite-React app in a browser, preferably a desktop browser.

Open the browser's developer tools. You can usually do this by right-clicking anywhere on the page and selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" from the context menu. Alternatively, you can use keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Option+I (Mac) to open the developer tools.

Once the developer tools are open, you will see a toolbar or menu options at the top or side of the browser window. Look for an icon or toggle button that represents the device mode or responsive design mode. It is usually represented by a small mobile phone or tablet icon.

Click on the device mode icon to activate the mobile mode or responsive design mode. This will change the browser window's dimensions and emulate the screen size of a mobile device.

You can select different device presets or enter custom screen dimensions to simulate various mobile devices. Additionally, you can switch between portrait and landscape orientations to test your app's responsiveness.

By following these steps, you can view and interact with your Vite-React app as if it were running on a mobile device. This allows you to test and fine-tune the layout and responsiveness of your app during the development process.
